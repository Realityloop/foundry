# Foundry

This composer project template downloads Drupal with the [Foundry install profile](https://www.drupal.org/project/foundry) and all of it's dependencies as a relocated document root.

The Foundry install profile is designed to be a good starting point for most websites, with a particular focus on administration experience.
